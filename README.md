Q4. Write a multithreaded program that implements the banker's algorithm. Create n threads that request and release resources from the bank. The banker will grant the request only if it leaves the system in a safe state. It is important that shared data be safe from concurrent access. To ensure safe access to shared data, you can use mutex locks. 




Q31. Write a C program to solve the following problem: 
Suppose that a disk drive has 5,000 cylinders, numbered 0 to 4999. The drive is currently serving a request at cylinder143, and the previous request was at cylinder 125. The queue of pending requests, in FIFO order is: 
86, 1470, 913, 1774, 948, 1509, 1022, 1750, 130 
Starting from the current head position, what is the total distance (in cylinders)that the disk arm moves to satisfy all the pending requests for each of the SSTF disk-scheduling algorithms? (for conceptual clarity refer the textbook)
